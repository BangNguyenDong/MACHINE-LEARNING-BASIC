# Machine Learning Basics Course

Welcome to the Machine Learning Basics course! This course is designed for beginners who want to learn the basics of Machine Learning and its applications.

## Course Overview

This course covers the fundamental concepts of Machine Learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation. Additionally, we will introduce some popular Machine Learning algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should have some basic knowledge of Python programming and data analysis. If you are new to Python, we recommend that you first complete a Python tutorial before starting this course.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific topic in Machine Learning. The modules are:

1. Introduction to Machine Learning
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Supervised Learning
4. Unsupervised Learning
5. Model Selection and Evaluation
6. Popular Machine Learning Algorithms

Each module contains several lessons, each with a video tutorial, a set of practice exercises, and a quiz. You should complete each lesson before moving on to the next one.

## Getting Started

To get started with this course, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. We recommend using the Anaconda distribution, which includes Python, Jupyter Notebook, and many popular scientific computing libraries.

You can clone this repository to your local machine and open the Jupyter Notebook files to follow along with the course. The exercises and quizzes can be completed within the Jupyter Notebook files.

## Course Completion

To complete this course, you should finish all the lessons, exercises, and quizzes. Upon completion, you will have a good understanding of the fundamental concepts of Machine Learning and be ready to explore more advanced topics in the field.

We hope you enjoy the course and find it useful for your future Machine Learning endeavors!
